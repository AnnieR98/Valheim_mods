## Permission for Distribution with TheRuins

I assert that I am the creative owner of the attached/linked files. I hereby grant permission to distribute the Valheim build(s) listed in this tracking issue. The attached/linked builds can ***only*** be distributed with TheRuins, and not modified or re-uploaded elsewhere by TheRuins' maintainer.

Maintainer of TheRuins mod agrees to *remove* my builds from distribution in future versions of TheRuins if I so choose to revoke these permissions, as well as promptly release a new version of TheRuins without my content. This provision still applies if TheRuins changes hands.

## Build Files
Attached or linked are the `.vbuild`, `.blueprint`, or world save file containing such builds.

*Note: If linking a world file, please also mark the locations of the builds owned by you and attach a screenshot of the map, or include the world coordinates of each build using the `pos` [console command](https://valheim.fandom.com/wiki/Console_Commands).*
